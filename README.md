# Task-Induced Pyramid and Attention GAN for Multimodal Brain Image Imputation and Classification in Alzheimerâ€™s Disease
Paper link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9490307

## Summary

In practice, multimodal images may be incomplete since PET is often missing due to high financial costs or availability. Most of the existing methods simply excluded subjects with missing data, which unfortunately reduced the sample size. To address these problems, we propose a task-induced pyramid and attention generative adversarial network (TPA-GAN) for imputation of multimodal brain images.
