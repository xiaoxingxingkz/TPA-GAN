1. Filename is formated as "Label + ID" (1: AD, 0:NC), e.g., For the filename of 0_009_S_0862.mat, 0 is label and 009_S_0862 is ID.

2. Load Demo:
import scipy.io as sio
path = "./ADNI1_MRI_PET_ADNC_255/0_009_S_0862.mat"
img = sio.loadmat(path)
out = img['data']
mri_data = data[0, 76, 94, 76]
pet_data = data[1, 76, 94, 76] 

3. Complete dataset will upload in our next project.

4. Delete this file while training.
